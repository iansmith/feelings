This bit controls the step size of the 64-bit core timer . This may be 
important if you want the core timer to accurate represent the number of 
CPU cycles. The core timer pre-scaler is running of the APB clock. As the 
APB clock is running at half the speed of the ARM clock, you cannot get 
a timer value equal to the ARM clock cycles, even if the pre-scaler is set
to divide-by-one. This bit provides a means of getting close to the actual 
number of CPU cycles.
* If set the 64-bit core timer is incremented by 2.
* If clear the 64-bit core timer is incremented by 1.
This will still not get you the exact number of CPU cycles but will 
get you close to plus/minus one. Beware that if the core timer increment is 
set to 2 you will only get either all even or all odd values
(Depending on if the initial value you write to it is even or odd).`,

Bit 8: Core timer clock source
This bit controls what the source clock is of the 64-bit Core timer. 
Actually it selects the source clock of the Core timer prescaler but 
that amounts to the same end-result. If set the 64-bit core timer 
pre-scaler is running of the APB clock. If clear the 64-bit core timer 
pre-scaler is running of the Crystal clock. Note that the APB clock 
is running at half the speed of the ARM clock. Thus the pre-scaler is 
only changing every second CPU clock cycle.`,

		"CoreTimerPrescaler": {
			Description: `
timer_frequency = (2**31/prescaler) * input frequency, with
(Pre-scaler <= 2**31).

I have not found any information on how fast this timer should run. It 
seems common to run it of the processor clock. However that would not 
give a reliably timing signal when the frequency of the processor is variable. 
Therefore the source of the timer can come from either the external crystal 
or from a CPU related clock.

To give maximum flexibility to the timer speed there is a 32-bit pre-scaler. 
This prescaler can provide integer as well as fractional division ratios.

Thus setting the prescaler to 0x8000_0000 gives a divider ratio of 1. Setting 
the prescaler to 0 will stop the timer. To get a divider ratio of 19.2 use: 
2^31/19.2 = 0x06AA_AAAB. The value is rounded upwards and introduces an 
error of 8.9E-9 which is much lower than any ordinary crystal oscillator 
produces. Do not use timer values >2^31 (2147483648)`,

			Description: `The code has a single local timer which can 
generate interrupts. The local timer ALWAYS gets its timing pulses from the 
Crystal clock. You get a 'timing pulse' every clock EDGE. Thus a 19.2 
MHz crystal gives 38.4 M pulses/second.  The local timer has a 28-bit 
programmable divider which gives a lowest frequency of 38.4/2^28 = 0.14Hz.
The local timer counts down and re-loads when it gets to zero. At the 
same time an interrupt-flag is set. The user must clear the interrupt flag. 
There is no detection if the interrupt flag is still set when the next
time the local timer re-loads. 

When disabled the local timer loads the re-load value. Bit 32 is the 
status of the interrupt flag. The interrupt flag is always set upon a 
re-load and is independent of the interrupt enable bit. An interrupt is
generated as long as the interrupt flag is set and the interrupt-enable 
bit is set.`,
