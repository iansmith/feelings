	Description: `
A free running 64 bit timer and 2 (ne√© 4) match registers.  Only two
of these registers are actually available, so only those two have been
documented.

This is sometimes called the Chapter 12 timer, referring the BCM2835
ARM peripherals manual and to disambiguate from the Chapter 14 timer
and the ARM local timer.

The System Timer peripheral provides four 32-bit timer channels and a 
single 64-bit free running counter. Each channel has an output compare 
register, which is compared against the 32 least significant bits of the 
free running counter values. When the two values match, the system timer 
peripheral generates a signal to indicate a match for the appropriate channel. 
The match signal is then fed into the interrupt controller. The interrupt 
service routine then reads the output compare register and adds the appropriate 
offset for the next timer tick. The free running counter is driven by the 
timer clock and stopped whenever the processor is stopped in debug mode.`,

status bit and the corresponding interrupt request line.`,
